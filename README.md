A calculator for determining and finding the right solar power products for your project.

Created for HemeraProject.com, this app is a basic watt-hour calculator with an easy to use interface. With it, eople who lack an in depth understanding of how electricity and solar power work can still get pointed in the right direction for finding the products they need for their own projects or lifestyle needs.

When completed, it should take in basic questions about the type of products a person hopes to power and for what duration, and output descriptions of the products that most likely fit their needs and links to places where those products can be purchased.
